# POA Network Wiki
__*The platform for smart contracts and DApps*__

POA Network is the first Ethereum-based public network with Proof of Authority consensus, reached by independent validators. We are building a public network for smart contracts that combines speed, security, and cost efficiency. We see POA Network as a first step towards realizing our vision of horizontal blockchains scalability by creating a swarm of blockchains with Proof of Authority consensus, connected by interledger protocols.
